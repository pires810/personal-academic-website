I'm an Associate Professor in School of Informatics of Xiamen University. I'm in Department of Information and Communication Engineering and Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology (Xiamen University), Ministry of Education.

My research interests are wireless communications and signal processing, with special focus on underwater acoustic communications, including algorithm design, system development and performance analysis.

I got PhD degree from University of Connecticut, supervised by [Prof. Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) (IEEE Fellow). Previously, I worked in College of Underwater Acoustic Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, and AquaSeNT (USA).
