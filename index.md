* I'm an Associate Professor in School of Informatics of Xiamen University. I'm in Department of Information and Communication Engineering and Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Communication and Marine Information Technology (Xiamen University), Ministry of Education.

* My research interests are wireless communications and signal processing, with special focus on underwater acoustic communications, including algorithm design, system development and performance analysis.

* I got PhD degree from University of Connecticut, supervised by [Prof. Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) (IEEE Fellow). Previously, I worked in College of Underwater Acoustic Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, and AquaSeNT (USA). 

* I'm a senior member of IEEE, an associate editor for the IEEE Open Journal of Communications Society & Journal of Marine Science and Engineering. I serve as a technical reviewer for many journals and conferences, and I received the IEEE Communications Society's Exemplary Reviewer Award for the IEEE Communications Letters in 2013.

* Looking for self-motivated students to join our research on wireless communications, especially on the development of underwater acoustic communication systems.
